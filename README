Libvmath was developed by Mattias Holm (lorrden at openorbit dot org).

Libvmath is primarily a vector maths library, it implements many different
vector and matrix routines. It also provides types and functions for working
with "large world coordinates", a hybrid integer / floating point coordinate
mechanism that ensures similar precision independent on how far from the origin
the coordinate is.

There are two ways to compile the library, either with the Xcode project file or
using the CMake build system.

Documentation is lacking at the moment, but it will be added later on.
